      #Not initialized the counter with 1 
          let count = 1;

      #Bug   if you win not the first try the program end
          This happens cuz you just get the value one time before execute the function

          HOW TO CORRECT
              You must to get the diferent value each moment the user click on the button 
              In oder hand you have to put the querySelector(valueinput) into the function

    Learnings:

    1[] 
      If you make without think first what is the path (actions by the user and reactions after him did something) and events and variables you'll lose time findind new bugs and try to fixed them;
    2[]
      class names are understand by querySelector like the same way it is on a file css
